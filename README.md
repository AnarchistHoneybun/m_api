# M_api

API key buying selling system built on a really robust database. We probably
aren't even utilizing half of the cool things we can do on it and even so we're here.
That being said:

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server

That's it! You're good to go! Go to `localhost:3000` to see the app running.
Contact us for user keys and test credentials to see it in action.

self documents pretty well.
